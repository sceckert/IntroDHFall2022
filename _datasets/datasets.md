## Datasets 

For the purposes of this class, we're going to be focusing on datasets that are better suited to humanities projects (data relevant to questions about literature, art, history, and culture). 

### General resources for humanities data:

- Melanie Walsh has compiled an excellent [list of links to datasets](https://github.com/melaniewalsh/Intro-Cultural-Analytics/blob/master/book/Datasets/Datasets.ipynb), including a dataset of Nobel Laureates 1901-2017), a dataset of dialogue in 2,000 Hollywood films, a collection of European novels, a collection of Colonial South Asian literature, network data about Game of Thrones Character relationships), an archive of Donald Trump's Tweets, and all the obituaries published in the NYTimes from 1852-2007
- Miriam Posner's [list of datasets](http://miriamposner.com/classes/dh201w21/final-project/datasets/) for her graduate course.

### Other humanities data resources: 

- [*The Pudding*'s repository of data](https://github.com/the-pudding/data#data-sets) connected to their data journalism stories
	- A heads up: with *The Pudding*, you'll want to be careful to say something new about the data beyond the original story that the dataset was assembled for. 
-  Jeremy Singer (an independent data journalist) also has running dataset newsletter called *Data is Plural*. You can view the [archive of datasets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) or subscribe [here](https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural). 
	- A heads up: unlike the more curated sets of humanities data above, these datasets lists are in varied formats, and come with *varying* levels of contextual detail.
