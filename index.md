### Course Description

This seminar introduces the digital humanities by exploring key debates around the meaning of humanities data. Like "slow food"––a movement where diners, farmers, and chefs rethink what and how we produce and consume––we will explore data as local, embedded, and requiring careful critical reflection. How can computational tools help us to understand art and literature? What do digital archives reveal (or obscure) about the people who make them? We will explore the foundations of this field while also discussing concerns that emerge when accessing and maintaining digital projects in time and across global and local contexts.

Weekly readings will introduce the key concepts, methods, and histories of digital humanities. Students will explore these methods through reflection papers, short code assignments, exercises in data curation and critique, and final projects. Over the course of the semester, students will work in collaborative teams to plan and design final projects. Course meetings will alternate between discussions and workshops with data from local libraries and special collections, including Firestone Library Special Collections.
