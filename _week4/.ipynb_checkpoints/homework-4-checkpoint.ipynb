    "In this homework, we're going to be learning how to use Python to perform some basic computational analysis of a text file and a small set of structured data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some of what we'll be learning will build on what we learned to do with the command line interface: perform basic searches across text, identify patterns, count words and lines. Python also allows us to far more robust analysis: we can write scripts that allow us to re-use code, manipulate and view data. \n"

    "    - To do this, go to the top menu in Jupyter Labs, click on the Save icon, and then and click on the \"Download\" button. This will download as a Notebook (.ipynb).  This is what you'll be turning in as your homework. \n",

    "    - Once in Jupyter labs, navigate to the folder on your desktop with our course materials, then navigate into the directory called \"_week4\"\n",

    "The dataset we'll be working with in this set of exercises is comes from Anelise Shrout's [Bellevue Almshouse Dataset](https://gih.hosting.nyu.edu/almshouse/the-almshouse-records/). The Bellevue Almshouse Dataset includes information about Irish-born immigrants who were admitted to the almshouse in the 1840s.\n",

    "The Bellevue Almshouse was part of New York City's public health system, a place where poor, sick, homeless, and otherwise marginalized people were sent — sometimes voluntarily and sometimes forcibly. Devastated by widespread famine in Ireland, many Irish people fled their homes for New York City in the 1840s, and many of them ended up in the Bellevue Almshouse. This dataset was transcribed from the almshouse's own admissions records.\n",
