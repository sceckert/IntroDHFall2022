# Final Project Proposal 

The final project proposal is the first stage of the project. It will take the form of a short write-up that will clearly and concretely describe your questions, data, methods and plan for the next few weeks.

- What are your initial research questions?
- What scholarship does your research draw upon and further? (This could be digital humanities scholarship, or broader questions in relevant humanities fields)
- How you will translate your research questions into hypotheses?
- Which methods and datasets do you plan to use?
- How do you plan to communicate your results? 

This write-up should be **2-3 pages** and should lay the groundwork for the project, including a **timeline** to completion and **how you plan to divide the work** required to make the project.

NOTE: "Project" is deliberately left open-ended. Your project's "results" could be preliminary exploratory data analysis and your communication forum could be a visualization or a poster (or a simple GitHub website). We'll be learning how to set up and use git-hub for doing collaborative analytical work on your projects and for sharing your results.
