# Data Biography


> "Data sets are the results of their means of collection."

For this assignment, you're going to be writing a short "biography" of [a humanities dataset](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHFall2022/blob/main/_datasets/datasets.md). Like a traditional biography,  a data biography is a narrative that recounts the origins, life, and death of a dataset––along with any important events connected to that dataset the way. 

The dataset you choose for this assignment can be be a dataset that you're interested in working later, or simply a dataset that piqued your interest––I've included a list below of some possible datasets you might consider.

The goal of this assignment is to give you the preparation to ask more nuanced and precise questions about a dataset that you might analyze, and to practice the kind of documentation that makes the foundation of a good project.

## What is a data biography? 

Heather Krause's original article, ["Data Biographies: Getting to Know Your Data" (2017)](https://gijn.org/2017/03/27/data-biographies-getting-to-know-your-data/) describes data biography as a way for data journalists to develop a deeper understanding of the context of a given dataset before jumping to conclusions about the kind of stories that might be inferred from it. 

In updated version, ["An Introduction to Data Biography" (2019)](https://weallcount.com/2019/01/21/an-introduction-to-the-data-biography/), Krause describes data biography as guided by four central  questions:


> **Who**:
> > Who collected the data:

> >  Who owns the data?

> **How**:

>> The methods behind the data collection design and process?

>> What sources that were drawn on to collect the data?

>**Where**:
>>In what locations was the data collected?

>>Where is the data stored?


>**Why**:
>> For what purpose was the data collected?

>**When**:
>> When was the data collected?



For Krause, the first step of a data biography is systematically collecting what information  youabout your dataset. In our class, we're going to focus on the narrative context that You can use [Krause's template spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ych5dzBfGLoQGYb-Jtq6VMn0PKdj_Y_tk6nGjopEduw/edit#gid=0) as a starting point, but your final data biography should move beyond the spreadsheet to put this contextual information into a narrative about the life of your dataset: what spurred the creation of your dataset, how your dataset was produced, who is was produced for, where it lives.

To write a data biography will require a little bit of digging. Information about who collected or processed data can be obscure or missing. Try, whenever possible, to comb through the fine print: read the "About," "Methodology," and "Credits pages for a project. It might be the case that this information is simply not available––think about how you might record and document that fact.


A few additional notes: 
- Krause's spreadsheet is just a starting point! You might find that the information you want dig into about your dataset requires different fields. The original template was designed for data journalists––you'll notice that in the example dataset included. 
- In the process of writing a biography about your data set, you might want to think about additional categories, like **what format the data is in** (is it a CSV (a spreadsheet of comma-separated values)? A collection of texts? A collection of images? A JSON file?), **how the data was processed/modified/curated**, whether the data comes with a  **data dictionary** (a list explaining what data's fields or variables mean), and **whether** the data collected, transcribed, or encoded from **another source,** (like a collection of artwork, a library catalog, a set of surveys, or a set of historical record books). You could think about the layers of mediation (how **many** levels of mediation are there)

## Where can I find a humanities dataset?


I've compiled a [list of possible datasets (and some links to aggregations of datasets in the humanities)](../_datasets/datasets.md). I've selected many of these because the data is in a workable format (and might be of interest to you for a final project). Before trying to find your own, check out the list!

If you'd like to use a different dataset than the one listed, feel free to do, just make sure that it fits the criteria of a humanities dataset (rather than, say, a set of scientific or civic data). Miriam Posner has [a helpful blog post explaining what data means in the context of humanities disciplines](http://miriamposner.com/blog/humanities-data-a-necessary-contradiction/).  

## What you'll turn in:

-  A 2-3 page (double-spaced) reflection paper that concisely
	-   introduces your dataset and the details what the dataset is, where it came from, where it lives, who collected it, who owns it, how it was collected, why was it collected, when it was collected
	-   a short discussion of how these details might impact the kinds of questions we can responsibly ask of our dataset.
- Your accompanying spreadsheet (if you used one as part of the process)
