# Final Project

+ Proposal due: **Wednesday April 6**
+ Presentation of current final project work:  **Week of December 6 and 8th**
+ Final project reflection paper turned in: **Dean's Date - Friday December 16**


## What you'll turn in for the final project proposal:

This is a 2-3 page outline of your research timeline, research questions, the dataset(s) you plan to work with, your methods, and how you plan to communicate your findings (within a Jupyter notebook, on a GitHub repository, or some other mode) See the [final project proposal prompt](https://github.com/sceckert/IntroDHFall2022/tree/main/_assignments/final-project-proposal) for full details.

## What you will turn in for the final project:

For your final project reflection paper, you'll turn in your **project files** (eg. dataset, Jupyternotebook, link to a GitHub repository, etc) a **paper** (min. 4-5 pages, maximum 15 pages) to accompany your project.

For the project files, you should plan to turn in a **Jupyter notebook**(or link to a GitHub repo with a Jupyter notebook) along with any relevant data files.  If you feel that a Jupyter notebook is not the best way to represent or carry out your project you should talk with your instructor about alternatives. 

In this **paper**, you might discuss:
-  the argument you've developed about your findings
-  the finalized state of your project (including relevant visualizations or analysis)
- your final findings  (incorporate feedback from today's presentation)
- An argument about what you found. 
	- This can be about the data of your project. Or it can take the form of an argument about the methods you used
- Any final reflections on the next stages of the process.
